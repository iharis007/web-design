		<p>Today we are celebrating IEEE Day, the anniversary of the first time IEEE members gathered to share technical ideas in 1884. From Alexander Graham Bell and Nikola Tesla to Thomas Edison and more, many IEEE members have been considered some of the greatest inventors of all time. Throughout history, inventions such as the light bulb, alternating current, the cellphone, the internet, the autonomous vehicle, the video game console, Wi-Fi, and more, have all been made possible through the work of IEEE and its members. Whether you know it or not, IEEE has a big impact on the devices you use every day and is currently leveraging technology for a better tomorrow</p>
